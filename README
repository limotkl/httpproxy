compile the code : make all
run the code : ./proxy number

IF CACHE_MISS,it will take a little bit long time to download, PLEASE WAIT A MINUTE(about 15s);


notice:
	1.In the code if you set "int cacheinfo = 0" to 1 it will print cache useage information;

	2.Maxmum web size is WEBPAGESIZE 30000000, can't donwnload file that is larger than this;

	3.The cache can only hold 10 different entries.

	4.The proxy can handle 5 threads at the same time;

	5.If the single file size is larger than cache size you set, it will give you worning.

	6.For cache replacement if the cache becomes full, delete the Least Recently Used (LRU)entry, if still not big enough for the new file keep deleting untill big enough.
